<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am a new software developer taking classes for WGU.
    While working towards my degree in Computer Science, I am also a mechanical service operator at Union Pacific.
    I like playing games with my friends, reading online webcomics or enjoying some quality time with my fiance.
    If you're interested in working with me, please feel free to reach out!

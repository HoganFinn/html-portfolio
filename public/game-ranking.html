<h3>Omega Strikers</h3>
<p>A beautil mesh of Air Hockey and League of legends in an anime fashion. The soundtrack is amazing and well-produced.</p>

<h3>Valheim</h3>
<p>A very big sandbox crafting survival game with beautiful graphics. Amazing with friends as well.</p>

<h3>Phasmophobia</h3>
<p>A horror objective-based ghost detective game. Extremely fun online, alone or with close friends.</p>
